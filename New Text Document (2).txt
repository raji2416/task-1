          HTTP is an upper layer network protocol for transmitting data in the form of hypertext HTML document
          and arbitary data.with this protocol ,the browser accepts data from servers and then displays it in a 
          user friendly form.the browser also sends user data to the server via HTTP
 HTTP/2
                  
        HTTP/2 (HTTP/2.0) is the second version of the HTTP network protocol, based on the SPDY application layer
         protocol for accessing the web. In the past, websites were simple and did not require much capacity. On
          modern web resources with high-quality images, JAVA scripts, CSS, flash animations, and other elements, 
          just one page can weigh about 2 megabytes. With the introduction of new technologies, it became increasingly 
          difficult for the protocol to handle pages with "heavy" content, which led to their slow loading.
